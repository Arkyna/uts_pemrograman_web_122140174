                    I had a great time working on this project, even though I had very little timeâ€”an all-too-familiar habit of mine. I managed to finish it, albeit just barely. After numerous consultations, I finally submitted it on time. Most of the time was lost in developing the website's concept and theme, but overall, it was an enjoyable journey despite the learning curves, no need to read all of this honestly this is just a placeholder!
